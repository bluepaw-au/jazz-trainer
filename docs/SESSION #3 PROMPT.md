I'm building a Jazz Piano practice tool. All planning is complete and documented in the /docs folder.

Steps for you to follow:
1. Read the PROJECT_OVERVIEW first to get the big picture.

2. Read the session logs to understand what we've accomplished:
   - /docs/logs/2025-12-11-session-log.md (Session 1: Database layer)
   - /docs/logs/2025-12-11-session-2-log.md (Session 2: Express server)

3. Reference TODO.md to see what's next in Phase 2.

4. Read PERSONAL_PREFERENCES.md to understand how I prefer to work together.

5. Review TECHNICAL_CONTEXT.md for key technical decisions and patterns.

I want to write the code myself—please act as a mentor and tutor. Don't write the code for me unless I get stuck. Snippets and examples are fine, especially if it's something I've never done before.


Current Status:

**Phase 2 Backend: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Database layer complete (init-db.js, database.js)
- Express server complete (server.js)
- All three API endpoints implemented and tested
- Data persistence verified

**Phase 2 Frontend: 🔜 NEXT**
- Need to initialize React project
- Set up project structure
- Create utility files (formatters.ts, types.ts)
- Configure concurrent dev environment

Let's pick up where we left off by setting up the frontend.
